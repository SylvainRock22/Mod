== Toggle Passives ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/togglePassive.png}} | Flags can easily make toggle passives. The general setup is shown to the left. The Flag Toggle mechanic and Flag condition would use the same key for the flag. The "Heal" mechanic in this case would be where the passive effects would be. |

== Temporary Effects ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/temp.png}} | Flags can also make temporary imbued effects. The example to the left causes projectiles fired by the player to explode on impact for a duration after casting the skill. You can use other triggers to do other interesting effects. The important part is the Flag condition. |

== Channeling ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/channel.png}} | When you want to do an effect while channeling, flags can be used! While channeling, the "channel" flag is active. Check for that in a repeat mechanic, and you can apply effects while channeling. |
| _______________________________ 

== No Targets Available ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/noTargets.png}} | Flags are also useful for checking if there are targets available. The example shows trying to do an effect in an area, setting a flag if it affected anything. Checking for the flag after lets you know if there were any targets. |
