Players are able to profess into classes that each have their own sets of skills, damage, health, and mana. Each class can also profess into additional classes one they reach the required levels.

What classes profess into what other classes is entirely configurable along with the messages that are displayed. 

Also, if a player doesn't like their class, they can reset themselves at any time so that they can choose a new class! This command does prompt for a confirmation as well in case a player is not aware that the command fully resets them.
