== Supported Operations==
The available operations are:

* Addition ( + )
* Subtraction ( - )
* Multiplication ( * )
* Division ( / )
* Exponent ( ^ )

== Order of Operations ==
PEMADS rules do not apply to these formulas. They are read from left to right other than parenthesis. For an example of operator precedence, the following equations are identical and equate to 0:

{{{2-5*4+2(5+1)^2}}}
{{{((2-5)*4+2(5+1))^2}}}
