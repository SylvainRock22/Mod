== Using Values ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/useValues.png}} | Each time you set a value using one of the "Value" mechanics, you can then use those numbers in other effects. To do so, instead of entering a number, enter the value key for one of the effect options. |

== Randomness ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/random.png}} | Using the "Value Random" mechanic, you can create an element of randomness to spells. The example is a thunderstorm that randomly strikes lightning around the caster. |

== Increasing Effects ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/increasing.png}} | With "Value Add", you can create effects that grow stronger over time. The example would increase every time the player kills something. You can then use that value in mechanics for other skills (or the same one) such as damage or something for interesting stacking buffs. |

== Wave Effects == 
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/chain.png}} | Similar to the last example, using "Value Add" combined with offsets, you can make effects that continue along a line for a wave-like effect. The example releases a wave of explosions. |
