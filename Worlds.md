== Overview ==
You can disable SkillAPI in certain worlds or set it to only work in specified worlds to prevent it from interfering with other game modes.

== Setting Up ==
At the bottom of the config.yml, there's the "Worlds" section. It provides 3 options:
| enable | Whether or not to restrict what worlds SkillAPI affects |
| use-as-enabling | If true, the worlds list will be the only worlds SkillAPI works in. Otherwise, they will be the worlds SkillAPI doesn't work in |
| worlds | The list of worlds |
