== Your first Skill ==
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/skill.png}} | When making a new skill, you'll see the "Skill Details" section where you change general information and attributes for the skill. |
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/done.png}} | After you're done with the details, scroll all the way down and click on the "Done" button to start giving it actual effects. |
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/trigger.png}} | Click on the "Triggers" button to choose how your skill will activate. You should probably choose "Cast" for your first skill as that makes the skill work when a player casts the skill. |
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/child.png}} | Now click on "Add Child" on the Trigger that you added. This brings up all available effects you can do. |
| {{https://people.rit.edu/sms6462/mc/help/img/skillSetup.png}} | Try adding the "Single" target type and then add a "Damage" mechanic to that. This will give you a targeted damaging skill. It should look like the image to the left. |
